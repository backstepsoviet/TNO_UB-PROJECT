 tnoub_chi.1.d:0 "The atmosphere of celebration dissipated from Nanjing City, and the noisy National Auditorium became quiet again. Gāo Zōngwǔ came here alone, and he took a rare break for himself.\n\n At this moment, he is like an ordinary kind old man, looking at the huge photo paintings hanging on the wall in front of him - one is Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and the other is former President Wang Jingwei. The two huge paintings look bright against the red curtain wall. Extraordinarily, extraordinarily eye-catching. As a diplomat who has dealt with the Japanese before and is now dealing with them, Gāo Zōngwǔ is very aware of their greed. The ugly faces of the plutocrats during the previous Nanjing crisis are all reflections behind these puppets. The true face of the controller: The so-called Pan-Asianism itself is a big lie. He knows from the bottom of his heart what kind of person Wang Jingwei is now on the altar.\n\nGāo Zōngwǔ looked to the other side again, With just one glance, he averted his eyes - he was ashamed to face the Founding Father. The\"Three People's Principles\" once proposed by the Founding Father had been twisted into such unbearable fallacies, and he was also one of the chief culprits. He turned the people into He was sent into the belly of the steel behemoth, slaughtered his compatriots with guns and cannons, and begged for mercy in front of the Japanese master, so that he could achieve the completion of today's three modernizations. If everything is only about deeds and not about heart, then he is undoubtedly the sinner of China. He couldn't tell the difference.\n\nGāo Zōngwǔ looked at his watch and saw that the time was almost up. He gave himself 36 hours of leave and it was time to return to his job. Disputes within the government and the country's fragmentation. And the huge gap with the Japanese army will not wait for him. Gāo Zōngwǔ will no longer be as hesitant as it was 40 years ago. This time the cause of the fight for freedom will not be in vain."

Chinese needed this opportunity to show himself to the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the world so much that he had not rested for a long time. But today, a letter covered with the dazzling national emblem in fire paint was delivered to him - this was a letter from Manchukuo .\n\nAlthough Gāo Zōngwǔ was prepared, to be honest, he was still a little surprised. A diplomatic letter of this level did not come with any advance notice. As a seasoned diplomat, he frowned. After a moment of hesitation, he still took it. He picked up his letter opener and unfolded the gold-embroidered letter inside.\n\n\"Dear President of the Republic of China——President Gāo Zōngwǔ\n\nAs a sincere brotherly country in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Republic of China On behalf of all members of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Manchurian Empire is sincerely pleased with your brilliant achievements.\"Gāo Zōngwǔ's hand holding the letter trembled slightly, but he soon calmed down and continued to read.\n\n\"As required, the Co-Prosperity Sphere Summit should have rotated to your country as the host, but in the end, considering this Due to the importance of this meeting and the complexity of the content discussed at the meeting, all countries in the Co-Prosperity Circle believe that the meeting should be held in Taiwan. Hereby...\"\n\nGāo Zōngwǔ put down the letter paper in his hand, and he no longer needed to read the content below. This was a naked insult, or more directly, it was a merciless humiliation. But he understood better that if no one in the Republic of China responded, the Japanese would not use this without any scruples. This is a method that is almost showing off to directly humiliate himself. Someone must\"get it\" before him.\n\nThinking of everyone's\"united will\" on the day of the conference, Gāo Zōngwǔ smiled bitterly and picked up the phone. He wants to have a good chat with these\"friends\", at least for now, he can't break up with them."

He just wanted to take a walk so that he could clear his thoughts.\n\nIn the slightly mist, Gāo Zōngwǔ walked along the As the steps of Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum went up, dewdrops stained his gray hair. Gāo Zōngwǔ stopped on the mountainside. He was ashamed to step forward. When he turned around and went down, he saw a familiar figure. The man was wearing a hat. , with a scarf wrapped around his neck and a thick folder tucked beside his side.\n\n\"Xisheng, you came very early.\"\n\n\"Aren't you the same? This is an old habit of mine, and I often come here every time I feel tired from writing.\"Táo Xīshèng smiled, and the two of them walked down the steps side by side.\"Brother Gao, why did you suddenly call me here? Although we haven't seen each other for a long time recently, the Nanjing Summit has been complicated recently, and so am I. I'm so busy that I'm dizzy.\" As he spoke, he tightened the document bag under his arm.\"As you know, I'm really not good at politics. Now I also want to find a successor and then go to a national university to be a teacher.\"\n\nGāo Zōngwǔ looked at Táo Xīshèng and said these words with a half-smile. His glasses shimmered in the early morning sun, hiding his eyes. He also responded in a joking tone:\"Why, you young people The students are making you angry again. They are so energetic and they have done a lot to modernize. This is a good thing.\"\n\n\"Usually this is indeed a good thing, but I don't know where the news came from that the Japanese have intervened in this summit again. My students are choking as if they have eaten gunpowder, but you have to know, Even I don't know about this, so who can say it's true?\"\n\nThe two walked to the pavilion. The plaque read\"Zhengqi Pavilion\". Táo Xīshèng sat on the stone bench of the pavilion, put down the document bag he had been holding, and took out a few documents from it.\"You You know, what I can know here is definitely not as good as yours, but many people have indeed reported this information to me. I guess you also know something, so I brought this to you...\"\n\nGāo Zōngwǔ did not answer. He placed the documents on the stone table in front of him. Táo Xīshèng's familiar cunning eyes flashed behind his glasses.\"Xisheng, I can tell you the truth about this matter, but I will need your help later.\" Some help...\""

On the forum, he denounced domestic Pan-Asian factions and conservatives for compromising Japan's humiliating behavior of arbitrarily changing the venue of the summit, and asked President Gao to engage in a diplomatic struggle for the dignity of the country. Guards set up a cordon at the entrance of the Presidential Palace. Watching the impassioned students there from a distance.\n\n\"Pan-Asianism, in the early 1920s, once symbolized the liberation of East Asian nations, the counterattack against the enslavement of Western powers, and the unity of East Asian countries like brothers. Great vision, but now? The ambition of the Japanese Empire has put this idealism to shame. These liars and tyrants just changed their masks and turned this idealism into their excuse to break the bones and suck out the marrow of East Asian countries. Countless people were turned into withered bones under the baking sun. !\"\n\nThe speeches of the student representatives passed through the door of the Presidential Palace, through the indoor corridors, through the glass windows of the office, and reached Gāo Zōngwǔ's ears. But he just continued the work at hand, as if the chaos outside It seems that he has nothing to do with him. The Minister of Security walked to the door of the office worriedly, but was turned away by the secretary because he was busy.\n\nSuddenly, a student outside the window suddenly shouted:\"Traitor! Zhāng Rénlí! Zhāng Rénlí steps down!\"Down with the traitor Wáng Yīntài!\"\"The venue, which was like a powder keg, was instantly ignited by slogans. The leading student representative could not control the situation at all. The students started shouting slogans and rushed toward the gate of the Presidential Palace. The guards immediately stopped them. An outbreak broke out between the two sides. There was a physical conflict, which made the situation even more serious. Someone shouted,\"Gāo Zōngwǔ is also a traitor!\"National thief Gāo Zōngwǔ!\"\" and began to throw water bottles and stones at the guards, who took out riot shields and batons. At this moment, Gāo Zōngwǔ finally stood up from his seat, opened the glass window a crack, and looked out at the chaotic scene outside the window. Several student representatives Already being pinned to the ground by uniforms, more students were forced back by the guards, and the scene was still chaotic.\n\nGāo Zōngwǔ pursed his lips, returned to his desk, and stamped the letter he had just written with a personal stamp.

He was still waiting for another\"distinguished guest\" to come to the door.\n\nAfter a while, more The piercing whistle sounded, and a cloud of dust rose up in front of the presidential palace. A motorcade stopped in front of the presidential palace, and agents of the brigade executive committee got out of the car. This group of notorious scum aimed the muzzles of their submachine guns. In the crowd of students, the guards of Gāo Zōngwǔ quickly stood in front of them, fully armed, and separated the students from this group of people. The other team was watching the vicious dogs with high vigilance.\n\nA car The luxurious Toyota car finally parked in the square in front of it. The kind-hearted old man got out of the car. He adjusted his hat and turned back to the students with a smile and a nod. This This behavior made the students dare not speak out, because there were real guns pointed at them, so they could only look at the big traitor Zhang Rénlí, who they regarded as\"everyone can kill him\", with two guards beside him. He walked into the presidential palace with the help of others. After almost half an hour, the pro-Japanese leader came out of the building. By this time, the smile on his face had long gone, and his face was livid and the muscles on his face were tight. , got into the car and left without looking back. Gāo Zōngwǔ watched this\"friend\" leave, sat back in his office chair with satisfaction, and put away the documents that Táo Xīshèng had given him before on his desk. \n\nSo, this is his plan. The so-called politically innocent people do not exist. Gāo Zōngwǔ just asked his friend Táo Xīshèng to help. The reformers have a strong foundation among students. As long as someone starts with the reform If the news spreads in the name of the faction, the young and energetic students will take action spontaneously. Gāo Zōngwǔ does not need to clean himself from the summit incident, but has to go out into this muddy water by himself, and by the way bring the conservatives and The pro-Japanese faction has also been pulled down. Although this will cause hardship to his friends, at least in the next period of time, the other two factions will definitely take care of him.\n\nBut his goal has been achieved, and now he is at the Taipei Summit On this matter, the three parties have reached a rare true consensus - everyone must bear the blame together. As for the matter of having close private contacts with the Japanese, Gāo Zōngwǔ is willing to turn a blind eye for the time being. The pro-Japanese faction In exchange, the Japanese need to strive for conditions more favorable to Chinese. After all, they have been holding the banner of\"Pan-Asianism\" and shouting about the precious friendship of Asian brothers, while the conservatives want to use their powerful resources in the business world. If you use the power of money to influence the Japanese people's decision-making, you should spit out some of what you have swallowed before.\n\nThe students outside the window no longer chanted slogans.

Many students fainted due to fatigue and hunger, and were taken away by ambulances waiting aside. Go to the hospital. The guards stood at the door, their helmets reflecting the dim red light under the setting sun.\n\nThe sun set over the mountain and disappeared behind the Purple Mountain. The stars gradually climbed into the sky. This was in the gradually modernizing Jinling City. It is rare to see it here. The street lights turned on, illuminating the bright eyes of this group of students. They will never give in until they achieve their goals.\n\nA car drove up with its headlights on, and the national flag of the Republic of China was planted on the front of the car. Many students began to shout,\"President Gao is here!\"\"The students came up and saw that it was Gāo Zōngwǔ who was sitting in the back seat of the car.

Gāo Zōngwǔ moved closer to the students,\"I was the first to get this invitation letter. To be honest, I even wish I had never touched this letter.\" This letter is full of Japan's indifference and contempt for us. In the past few years, our country has grown into the pride of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. We all thought we could gain the respect of everyone, but the facts tell me that we were wrong.\"\n\nGāo Zōngwǔ paused. He saw the anger in the students' eyes, which was the anger against the unfair treatment received by the country. Their hands were clenching and shaking because of this anger. He sighed and continued: \"But I hope the students can be calmer and calmer. Former President Wang Zhaoming once said that Pan-Asianism is to unite Asian brothers and get rid of the bullying of European and American powers. His ideal has been confirmed in recent years. Although the road is tortuous, we do not have Western colonization. Completed its own modernization. This proves that this independent path is correct, and I think we should continue to follow this path.\"\n\nGāo Zōngwǔ looked around and raised his voice:\"The country has heard your voice, and I also promise that the government will fight with all its strength to fight for the position we deserve, and strive to get a place for our hard work.

You are the hope and pillars of the country's future. Impulsiveness cannot solve the problem. The future should be created by you!\"\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, the heavy door of the police station opened, and the arrested student representatives came out. Their clothes were clean, and their bruised faces that had been pressed to the ground were properly treated.

First, do not believe the verbal promises of any politician. Everything must be based on implementation; second, If diplomacy can solve the problem, it must be due to factors other than diplomacy.\n\nSo, he has no hope for this summit, and his promises to conservatives and pro-Japanese factions are just nonsense, but he needs this The crowd made a promise, because promises in the eyes of politicians and civilians are two different things. He wanted people to believe that President Gāo Zōngwǔ had tried his best to fight for dignity for the country. Pulling himself into the mud pit was just to step on the people he pulled in. Get out.\n\nThe Nanjing crisis has shattered Gāo Zōngwǔ's last illusion about Japan. Perhaps before that, he still had a glimmer of hope for the so-called peaceful rise, but after that, he realized that if Chinese wanted freedom , the only way to completely smash its own shackles is through war.\n\nBut now China needs time, mobilization, and whether Japan admits it or not, the Republic of China has become the second largest economic entity and the largest in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Even if the large industrial entities are reluctant, in order to maintain the balance and stability of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, Japan will eventually have to make some concessions to ease the conflict.\n\nThe plane was gradually descending, and through the clouds, he saw the brightly lit Taipei.

The Japanese invaders were finally driven out of the northwest Gobi, and now the area bordering the Majia Army border and the Co-Prosperity Circle is blocked by our soldiers.\n\n After learning the final result of the war, the Japanese government was furious and felt that this incident had caused them to lose face, so they prepared to attack the Ma Jiajun again. However, the Ma Jiajun was also dazzled by the sudden victory, and a group of radical officers began to appear who tried to attack us. And we are trying to mediate the two sides to resolve the conflict in a peaceful way. Helping the Ma Jiajun is our first step in resisting the Japanese order with force, but this time the action was too radical, and the results far exceeded our expectations.

He was holding a delicate rose in his arms. The redbud cap badge reflected the golden light in the sun. He made an appointment with Liangzi today and came to the brand-new seaside of Shenzhen. He wanted to be bold and complete something he had been preparing for a long time.\n\nAlthough he thought so, he was still so nervous that even the flowers were a little unsteady. , in this not too hot weather, sweat beaded on his forehead, and the back of the police uniform began to be wet with sweat, and he didn't even notice that Liangzi had walked to him.\n\n\"Officer Lin? \"Hearing Liangzi's soft call, she finally came back to her senses. She stood up and turned to look in the direction of the sound. The bouquet of roses slipped from his hand without holding it properly. A touch of fresh blue flowed into him. In his eyes, he was so stunned that he failed to catch the rose. The flower fell to the ground and fell to pieces, like blood splashing everywhere. He was so scared that Liangzi took a small step back. Lin Qiaochuan realized that he had made a big mistake, and he was a little afraid Looking up at Liangzi, he wanted to lower his body to pick up the broken bouquet. However, a gust of sea breeze blew by, and the bright red petals rose into the sky. Lin Qiaochuan followed the petals and finally looked up at Liangzi.\n\nThe vague memory of the first time is very different. For example, Lin Qiaochuan still vaguely remembers seeing a figure in a blue kimono at that time. Now Liangzi is more mature, with a blue dress and thin-framed glasses on the bridge of her nose. Now she is the editor-in-chief of a Hong Kong newspaper. His daily behavior is like that of a native Cantonese.\n\n\"Officer Lin, it's okay. I don't like roses too much, although it's a pity that they fell...\" Liangzi smiled and comforted Lin Qiaochuan, leading him for a walk along the street: \"So why did you invite me to your hometown today? Although I really want to take a vacation, I am also very busy at work. \"\n\n\"I want to take you to see my hometown again. This small fishing village has changed. Lin Qiaochuan took off his police hat and walked quickly in front of Liangzi, \"I still remember that you were a little disgusted with this place when you first came here, saying that it was just a small fishing village.\" \"The two of them walked down the stairs to the coast and stepped onto the light yellow beach. Looking along the coastline, they could see that the dilapidated houses had been renovated and the scaffolding had long been removed. There were fishing boats of all sizes moored in the port, as well as several A yacht, and further away, Sony's factory chimneys emitted purified white smoke. Shenzhen has become a vibrant new town.\n\nThe two continued to walk along the coast of the beach, and the seawater gradually rose. We hadn't seen each other for a long time, so we talked a lot, from our respective jobs to the pig's trotter rice on the street corner. The sea water had unknowingly reached Liangzi's feet, so she simply took off her leather shoes and stood barefoot on the shore. Holding the shoes, he turned to face Lin Qiaochuan. \"Officer Lin, I found that I really like this place. I like every corner of Guangdong, as well as the people who struggle here. After saying that, she turned back and continued walking along the seaside. Under the clear blue sky, the blue waves were rippling, and the sea and sky were the same color. Except for a few lonely clouds in the sky, it seemed that she was the only one left in the world in Lin Qiaochuan's eyes. He pinched the words in his jacket pocket. I had prepared something for a long time, and I wanted to say something that I had rehearsed many times. The bright sunshine hit Liangzi, and it was so beautiful that Lin Qiaochuan was a little discouraged.\n\nHe took out a cap badge from another pocket, which was the same one before It was worn by ordinary police officers. He gave the redbud cap badge to Liangzi. Liangzi was stunned for a moment, with various emotions in his eyes. In the end, he smiled and thanked him with a hint of sobs that Lin Qiaochuan could feel: "

Under the leadership of President Gāo Zōngwǔ, Chinese has just completed the modernization of education and science and technology.

He couldn't say anything in the board of directors for such a big deal.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, Táo Xīshèng felt that his previous words were a bit wasted, but it still had some effect.

However, at the same time, China is also one of the countries with the largest population in the world. Population pressure has already put the existing The agricultural system is overloaded, and all living beings need to eat with every mouth. How to feed every mouth is always the primary problem that troubles Chinese.\n\nWhat is even more tragic is that Japan relies on its post-war status to forcefully lower the price of Chinese exported grain. Forcibly snatching the remaining rations from the people's bowls, China eventually became the most ridiculous and sad country: a country with the largest food exports in Asia and the largest number of hungry people.\n\nBut no matter how tragic the reality, there will be people Trying to change, when such a huge demand cannot be changed, choosing to increase supply becomes the only option. Thousands of years of small-scale farming have pushed output to the end of what it can achieve, and only emerging science and technology can break through Limit. With this belief, every technician at the Academy of Agricultural Sciences has cultivated experimental fields one after another in the base, embraced the scorching sun with his arms, listened to the call of wind and rain with his heart, and felt the thick soil with his skin. I pray that one of the thousands of seeds will successfully give birth to a miracle, and spend year after year with nature and crops like this.\n\nI don't know whether it is repeated experiments that allow small probability events to happen, or whether it is natural Mother wants to reward outstanding and hard-working people. Miracles one after another thrive under the irrigation of the researchers' hard work. Food production increases every year, and more and more people can have enough to eat.\n\nBut this is not enough. We still do not have the ability to face sudden crises. Sudden accidents are likely to interrupt agricultural production and cause man-made famine.

Since the ground is not safe, you should flee underground to take shelter, and air raid shelters have emerged. However, if you want to protect everyone as much as possible during an air raid, It is necessary to dig enough air-raid shelters to send everyone to take refuge, which is a huge project that wastes people and money. Moreover, directly building a large number of air-raid shelters will inevitably arouse doubts in Japan and lead to unnecessary suspicion. More importantly, after the construction is completed, After that, the air-raid shelter will have no use if it is not in wartime, and the maintenance cost will be wasted.\n\nIn this case, building some facilities that can not only provide air defense but also have other uses in peacetime will solve the dilemma. The one that best meets this condition is the underground Parking lots and subways. Industrial development has caused the number of private cars in cities to increase day by day. The crowded above-ground city has long been unable to accommodate more and more cars. It is completely reasonable to build underground parking lots under buildings. In addition, after referring to the urban construction of Tokyo, Many big cities have proposed plans to build faster intercity subways, and thousands of miles of underground roads have been put on the agenda.\n\nThe highways continue to extend through the mountains, and the tunnels on the highways are located in most villages.

It can be said that each county has its own several anti-aircraft guns to prepare for emergencies. But the real purpose of anti-aircraft weapons is not to improve the weather. What the army needs is anti-aircraft guns that can support the steel sky. system.\n\nWith China's current industrial capabilities, it is only a matter of time before it can produce enough advanced anti-aircraft guns to meet military needs. But to adapt to the military air defense pressure in today's world, anti-aircraft guns alone are not enough. Military Theorists are all aware of the powerful potential of systematic air defense. In time, it will become the mainstream trend of future air defense forces. If you want to build a new air defense force, you must have your own air defense missiles.\n\nBefore, we had the idea that we could not do it. With the idea of buying it, I have already applied for an order for land-based air defense missiles from Japan. Japan immediately found a military industrial enterprise willing to accept this order, and the deposit has been paid long ago. It seems that everything is going well. The only problem is that it has not yet been completed. It has not been delivered. We have urged it countless times, but the response we get is always \"still under manufacturing\", and we have even been asked many times to advance funds again to support continued R&D and production.

But here, various rules and regulations restrict me. It was quite uncomfortable at first - but I have to adapt to this place. After all, we have learned in school that discipline is the life of the army.\n\nFor confidentiality reasons, I cannot tell you the specific location of our station.

We are all of the same age, we can get along with each other ideologically, and we can talk together. We are one of the few people I know in this strange place. It comforted me.\n\nThe high-intensity training every day made me unable to bear it, and the intensity was far more intense than the reserve force. I crawled and rolled around in the mud and in the wilderness every day, and I was so tired that sometimes I had no strength to walk. I wanted to go directly I lay down on the ground and stopped moving.

Every time this time, I would think of that scene Graduation party. We were walking on the street that night, and the exquisite products in the shop windows on both sides attracted our attention. When you leaned over and looked at the Japanese flag on the package, you said something dissatisfied - \"When can we be independent?\" \"\n\nI thought of my hometown. Ever since I can remember, we have been living under the pressure of the Japanese. Not far from our village, Japanese soldiers stood on the towers, staring at their prey like vultures. They are still monitoring us. My parents often told me that in the past, before the Japanese came, although we were poor, our lives at least had some dignity. We must study hard in the village primary school, get into a better school, and go to the city. Live a better life here, and even have the opportunity to drive away the Japanese.\n\nFrom elementary school to junior high school, then to high school in Nanjing, and now as a college student, I can see the torrent of modernization in , the factories and gears are turning again, and the wounds of our country are slowly healing. From poverty to star in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, this is a great leap, and now, I want to make my own contribution in this great torrent.

One day, I will step into the army. Go to the battlefield and fight the Japanese to the death. But I will not be afraid, nor can I be afraid. Because I know that what I do is not just for myself, but for our people and our future generations.

Nodding and bowing to the Japanese, what else could he do besides betraying national interests? But just like back then, the only option he chose was compliance. The riots in Yunnan back then had revealed the only result of resistance. It was better to accept the current situation than to suffer unnecessary destruction. Peace.\n\nBut Xia Wei has an unquenchable fire in his heart. He has compromised too much, and if possible, he does not want to give in again. He has been operating in Guangxi for decades and has transferred heavy taxes and permanent Endless military service is imposed on the people so that one day they can march north and put the broken mountains and rivers back together again. Unfortunately, this day has never come, and Guangxi alone cannot do this. Some people say that the modernization of Gāo Zōngwǔ Let China go from poverty to strength, he can enable China to compete with Japan, but now he is still groveling to Japan, how can he lead us to resist? Xia Wei once again fell into a dilemma, trying to use the anesthesia of alcohol to Let him forget the annoying troubles for the time being.\n\nHe just took a sip of wine, and soon he got drunk. \"Lian Po is old,\" and he can't even drink. How can he talk about saving the country? Get up? The clouds covered the waning moon, and the silver hook in the cup became looming. It was late at night, and it was time to stop drinking alone. Xia Wei put down the wine glass that had not yet reached his mouth, and had to think about how to deal with Gāo Zōngwǔ's Meeting, resistance and submission may be just a thought, but he can't get drunk in the moonlight."

 tnoub_chi.233.t:0 "On the day of the meeting"
 tnoub_chi.233.d:0 "Under the watchful eye of reporters, Xia Wei and Gāo Zōngwǔ formally met at the Nanjing Presidential Palace, and the symposium began soon afterwards. At the meeting, Gāo Zōngwǔ kept talking, what? Compatriots, what do people want? Xia Wei felt that these were just some high-sounding words, and responded with a few words according to the atmosphere. Then, Gao Zongwu said that he had decided to transfer Guangxi officials to the central government, and their positions would naturally be promoted rather than demoted. After hearing this, the officials accompanying Guangxi expressed their joyful acceptance directly on their faces, but Xia Wei chose to remain silent. He did not want to give up his persistence, so he could only avoid it with silence, but avoidance will not solve the problem, silence will only will be seen as a compromise, and compromise means that everything will continue smoothly.\n\nThe talks seemed to go smoothly. After all, there were no objections. The media also got the reports they wanted. Most of the participants were satisfied with the results. Very satisfied, it seemed that everything was over. Just as everyone was leaving in an orderly manner, Gāo Zōngwǔ stopped Xia Wei:\n\n\"Brother Xia, I see that you are very worried today. Are you willing to take some time to relax in Nanjing City?\" ? \"\n\nIn such a situation, Xia Wei certainly would not refuse. He understood that Gāo Zōngwǔ had something to say to him.\n\nThe two got into a special car and watched the streets of Nanjing under the guidance of the car. Once as an upper-class person, Cars are no longer the exclusive vehicles of the rich and powerful. Private cars together constitute the busy traffic flow in Nanjing; the traffic flow is mixed with many small trucks transporting goods to stores, although it is not possible to see what goods are in the car. , but what is certain is that they will all be put on the shelves and become a dazzling array of products, otherwise the merchants will not erect huge billboards on the buildings to proudly promote them. As the traffic moved, the special car stopped in front of a zebra crossing and waited. Green light. People on the zebra crossing are walking in a hurry. Some people are wearing suits and leather shoes, rushing to the company. Some people are dressed casually and neatly, carrying bags and enjoying shopping. There are still people wearing school uniforms from who knows which school. Maybe they are skipping classes. , what is certain is that there are no naked people on the street.\n\n\"We can make many things now, goods, food, clothes, and of course some more important things, trucks, Aircrafts, automatic rifles, artillery, tanks...Brother Xia, can Guangxi alone produce these now? \"\n\n\"Haha, President Gao thinks highly of us. We are just a province. How can we have such strength? \"Faced with the sudden question, Xia Wei could only deal with it awkwardly. He once again fell into thinking about whether to advance or retreat. Following Gāo Zōngwǔ's words, this time Xia Wei's attitude wavered a little. A strong and complete Chinese is definitely better than a Poor provinces have more hope of resisting Japan.\n\nThe green light turned on, and the special car passed the zebra crossing and continued forward. Inadvertently, the tall building next to it disappeared, and it seemed that it came to a hill. After a while, an archway appeared. , with three big characters engraved on it - Yuhuatai. This is a commanding height in Nanjing. Countless heroes once sacrificed their lives here to protect this place. Now it has become a scenic spot, trying to bury history in the mountains and forests, but history will only be forgotten by people. And die. There is a monument standing at the top of Yuhuatai. Looking from a distance in the scenic area, you can also see dots of pedestrians. People do not choose to forget, but people choose to remember in silence. In the busy city of Nanjing, everyone is working seriously Devoting themselves to the present and marching toward the future with their heads held high, fortunately, they have not forgotten the pain of the past.\n\n\"How does it feel like Nanjing City is like this now, Brother Xia? \"\n\n\"She is very beautiful, so beautiful that it is impossible to tell that she was destroyed 40 years ago. \"Looking at the hundreds of creatures in Nanjing City, Xia Wei had to admit that the modernization of Gāo Zōngwǔ has brought unprecedented development to Chinese. He also began to think about whether such people can really make Chinese stand up, or in other words, he began to resist. Xuri's hope was placed on Gāo Zōngwǔ, but unfortunately, Xia Wei still had doubts about whether this seemingly sanctimonious politician would really resist. The special car had already changed direction, and the trip was coming to an end, and time was running out. Looking up Xia Wei asked Gāo Zōngwǔ sincerely, eager to get a positive answer: \n\n\"Will we be free? \"\n\nGāo Zōngwǔ did not answer immediately, nor did he put on that professional smile. He took a deep breath and looked deeply into the distance:"
 tnoub_chi.233.a:0 "\"Maybe, no matter what, I will spare no effort for this. \""
 tnoub_chi.234.t:0 "Sudden disarmament"
 tnoub_chi.234.d:0 " Everyone was quite confused when they received the discharge notice, just as confused as when they were first captured as soldiers. When Xia Wei was the provincial chairman, he required all people to perform military service. If you don't want to Come and arrest any strong man from your family, unless all the strong men in your family have been arrested. Now Guangxi will be under the control of the central government, and the laws will be in line with the central government. Military service will naturally be exempted, and the gentlemen in the central government do not want so many All the active-duty soldiers in the army were simply discharged from the army.\n\n\"Not only do we endure hardship every day as soldiers, but we don't have much money, so I have long wanted to leave. But if I leave, where else can I go but go home?\" ? \"After receiving the notice, several soldiers discussed what they were going to do next. \n\n\" What else is there to think about? Just go home. No more farming at home? \"\n\n\" Just farming is not enough. I only have so much farmland. What I grow is not enough for my family to eat, let alone make a lot of money. \"\n\n\"Then what do you think we should do? \"\n\n\"Why don't we leave the province and go to the north to find a factory? We will work as workers in the factory. Although the wages are not much, at least we can make money in the city and there will be many opportunities to make a fortune in the future. \"\n\n\"Is that okay? \"\n\n\"Why not? Let's go together. If something happens, we can still have someone to take care of us. \"\n\n\"Hey, what are you talking about here? Have you thought about what you will do after you retire? \""

 tnoub_chi.235.t:0 "Reshaping Industry"
 tnoub_chi.235.d:0 "Guangxi's militarized society has cultivated a deformed industry. Apart from guns, it cannot produce many other industrial products. At the same time, the military factories are also quite backward, and the types of weapons they produce have long been eliminated by us. , Therefore, if you want to take advantage of Guangxi's industry, you must reshape it.\n\nIt just so happens that the soldiers who have just retired also need a job, and their demands are not high for the time being, just take care of the food. So. With the labor of a large number of manpower, what should be demolished, what should be built, and what should be modified, the factory soon took on a new look. Although the current output of industrial products is far from meeting demand, various factories are still under construction, and the output is also increasing. Gradually improving, the production process of military weapons has been updated, and the weapons produced are almost the same as our latest models. I believe that Guangxi's industrial strength will be fully stimulated soon."

 tnoub_chi.236.d:0 "The villagers in the mountains and forests are simple and simple, and they are also stubborn. They have remained unchanged for decades, and the repeated spring and autumn have made them accustomed to a boring but simple life, and their habits slowly gave birth to mountain people. The love for the land beneath our feet, this love becomes more and more pure as time goes by, so pure that love turns into stubbornness.\n\nSome people once tried to plunder this land, using guns and bullets to try to drive away the mountains. The mountain people tried to use their blood and flesh to preserve the mountains and rivers they were familiar with. The war failed, but the resistance did not. The invaders left the mountains and forests, and the villagers slowly returned to their original lives. The only thing that changed was their Hearts, love has become more stubborn and hot, and hatred of outsiders has become more obvious.\n\nThe mountains and rivers may not change, but politics will. The invaders are coming again, and they are coming with the outsiders. He learned to disguise, use a gentle mask to deceive everyone's trust, and then used steel behemoths to hollow out the mountains full of life in front of them. The mountain people would not allow the outsiders they hated to come back. They picked up farm tools and guns to block the way. In front of the visitors, outsiders were sternly shouted at to leave quickly, and allowing them to leave alive was the last courtesy of the mountain people.\n\nAll external visits were denied. What the villagers wanted was to maintain the status quo rather than let the Japanese step in. into their homes. Whether they should continue to be like this or let the villagers gradually accept the coexistence of things related to Japan is a serious and important question: if their love for the land and their hatred of the invaders are allowed to develop, we will be in the future We will have a firmer basis of public opinion when we resist, but it will also arouse our mother country's suspicion of us; if we guide them appropriately, temporarily forget their hatred, and accept modernization, then development and Japan's trust in us will be achieved at the cost of It's the people that become difficult to incite."

 tnoub_chi.237.d:0 "After adopting the plan of allowing the development of anti-Japanese sentiment, the attitude of the rural people towards us and the Japanese is still quite repulsive, and even intensified. At the beginning, the villagers only used hoes and sickles to drive us away , now almost all villages will take out guns to intimidate us, and there have been several bloody conflicts. If it were not for the protection of the guards, there might have been more casualties. Currently, the only thing that can be done is effective control in the towns. and management, it may take more time to effectively expand management institutions to rural areas, and the construction and development of Guangxi can only be implemented slowly.\n\nIn order to integrate local people into the big family of the \"Chinese nation\", student education and public opinion work. However, due to the involvement of anti-Japanese sentiment, the work progress was also slow, and more energy and time had to be invested to achieve the desired results.\n\nAccording to local reports, Japanese-owned companies and factories It encountered widespread resistance from the local people, and even incidents of vandalism and vandalism occurred in some places. The Japanese side had to close the company and withdraw from Guangxi. It seems that it will cost a lot to resist the threat posed by the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Guangxi people. The price.\n\nThose Japanese companies that want to enter Guangxi have expressed their dissatisfaction many times and repeatedly asked us to deal with the public opinion issues in Guangxi. After the bloody conflicts, the Japanese government also carried out several diplomatic pressures. To urge us to resolve the situation, we could only prevaricate the Japanese on the grounds that \"the poor mountains and rivers are full of unruly people, and the central government is beyond the reach of the central government, so I am afraid there is nothing we can do.\" After several rounds of wrangling, the Japanese reluctantly chose to give up with a lot of anger. This time the integrated warlords did not What benefits can the Japanese gain? They have also begun to doubt our actions internally. I am afraid that our next action will be more difficult."

 tnoub_chi.238.d:0 "After weighing the pros and cons, we finally chose to intervene and guide public opinion. Fortunately, there are local gentry who are willing to cooperate with us, otherwise the intervention would be difficult. The conflicts between the villagers and us were regulated by the collaborators Gradually, local newspapers also vigorously promoted the superiority of central government management. Villagers were gradually willing to talk to us, and guidance work was carried out.\n\nAfter local elites became factory directors, the people in the town and surrounding villages They were finally willing to enter the factory we opened, and the gears of industry began to turn. Realizing that not only would joining the factory not affect their normal lives, but they would also receive acceptable remuneration and industrial products they had never had before, word of mouth spread more and more The more people accept us, at least they are not as repulsive as before.\n\nThere is no progress in the development of new resources, and most people are still opposed to it. However, through the coordination of partners, the original mine is willing to be taken over by us. And agreed to expand mining and increase production. Such results can only be said to be unsatisfactory. If you want further results, you can only spend time and slowly test them.\n\nAfter many discussions, Japanese companies agreed to establish a joint venture with local companies to establish a subsidiary. When entering Guangxi, the minerals will be resold to them through middlemen, and we will be responsible for the cost. The Japanese are quite critical of such a troublesome method. After all, the Guangxi people do not like them. After getting what they want, the Japanese will not Say nothing more.\n\nFinally, the textbooks in the school have been replaced with our version, and the awareness of the \"Chinese nation\" will be slowly instilled in their minds, making them realize that we are all one family, and at the same time I hope the knowledge can cool some of their minds so that future communications will not be so tense."

 tnoub_chi.239.d:0 "Pang Weiqiang doesn't know where the name \"Guangxi Wolf Soldiers\" came from. He remembers that he never saw wolves in Guangxi when he was a child, and the elderly at home never mentioned that there were wolves there. , although scholars say it was given by the Guangxi people themselves, he still thinks that this name is more popular among outsiders. When he went to Chongqing to attend the military academy, his fellow villagers didn't mention this nickname much, but other people called it it very enthusiastically. Now that he is back, Look, it seems that there is no problem in saying this. Pang Weiqiang remembered that before leaving home, Guangxi was not as highly militarized as it is now, but now it has become a situation where all the people are soldiers and the voice of resistance is rising. If there is to be a war in the future, there is no other way. The place can be mobilized faster than Guangxi.\n\nObviously, the Japanese do not want Guangxi to remain like this, and the Chinese are reluctant to waste such high-quality soldiers. After many weighings, the Nanjing government finally decided to eliminate the rough and retain the fine. Elite soldiers with strong will and outstanding abilities formed a special mountain force, leaving the necessary garrison troops and disbanding most of the redundant troops. This good plan was recognized by both parties. The only shortcoming was that Pang Weiqiang himself was not notified in advance. It was indeed a happy event to be promoted to the division commander of the special forces, but I had not prepared at all in advance. I was still a little uneasy as to whether I was qualified for the job.\n\nThe landscape outside the car window gradually became more and more like the one in my impression. It's not far away from taking office. Putting away his complicated thoughts, Pang Weiqiang began to sort out the ideas for troop construction. Daily training of special forces is essential, and local instructors must be consulted on how to conduct mountain training. In addition, In addition, how to maintain Guangxi's mobilization capacity at a certain level is also a problem. The military quality of retired soldiers will decline over time, and Guangxi's advantages will disappear over time. Perhaps some militiamen need to be trained...\n\nFeeling Under the influence of inertia, Pang Weiqiang realized that he had arrived at his destination and set foot on his homeland after a long absence, and the heavy burden entrusted to him by the motherland immediately fell on his shoulders."

Try your best to praise Tai Gang.\n\nSince the defeat, Wei has not forgotten the chairman's wishes and raised troops in Guizhou. When the troops are strong and the horses are strong, he will send his troops north to drive out the Japanese pirates and restore China. However, I am stupid and make arbitrary judgments. Your Majesty's city government did not understand the strategy of restoring the country, merged affairs, neglected to respond, and delayed the overall plan. I am very ashamed.\n\nI know why the troops were dismissed, but Gui's military resources must not be wasted. The Japanese are very greedy, and according to the It has been a long time, and given time, the king's army will go south, and the leading soldiers will be the Gui army. Therefore, troops should be prepared in Gui to preserve the people's customs of being strong and good at fighting. At that time, hundreds of thousands of troops can be recruited from Gui, and then the south will be in danger. Solution.\n\nAlthough Begonia is no longer there, people's hearts are still the same. The freedom of China is what tens of millions of Chinese people have been longing for. Although I am a soldier, I am old now, so I am willing to serve the people of Lianpo, especially I'm afraid I won't be able to put on armor and take command and serve the country.

He thought of the luxurious government buildings in Nanjing, the towering reinforced concrete buildings, but the house in front of him was hard to imagine. It turned out to be the residence of General Zhang Zhizhong, the actual controller of Xinjiang. As the secretary opened the car door, Gāo Zōngwǔ slowly stepped out of the car.

However, as soon as he joined the army, he was sent to exterminate the guerrillas in Jiangxi, Fujian, and then caught up with the Longyun rebellion in the southwest. He participated in the task of suppressing bandits and was recognized as a combatant. With rich experience, he was sent to fight in Guizhou. Although he was very disgusted with fighting Chinese people, and he preferred to save his life rather than kill the enemy on the battlefield, over the past few years, he had become a company commander in a daze.

In fact, he discovered just outside the city that there was no one working in the farmland. None of the farmers. At this time, an officer got off the jeep in front of it, that was their battalion commander. The battalion commander glanced meaningfully around the depressed town and said: \"They are gone. \"\n\n\"Who is gone? \"The adjutant expressed doubts.\n\n\"The communist bandits, they took away almost all the residents and all the property, leaving us with an isolated city. \"\n\n\"Communist bandits?

Just when everyone thought he would become an engineer after graduation, he made a decision that surprised everyone: to join the army. He believed that relying on his high academic qualifications, he would definitely have a good career in the army. He would become the adjutant of a high-ranking official and rise to the top in one fell swoop. But to his surprise, he was assigned to the position of an automobile soldier because of his advanced mechanical education.

Some even held spears and knives. But in their cold eyes, Xiao Cheng couldn't help but shudder. He ran nervously into the queue, and he was younger than him. The older comrade reminded him: \"Stand up quickly! \"\n\nAfter a few more minutes, the national army stood sparsely in a horizontal line. In the distance, a senior military officer of the national army standing on a high platform showed a complicated expression. As the national army finally formed a line, , a messenger loudly announced: The incorporation ceremony of a certain unit of the former National Revolutionary Army and the National Revolutionary Army will now begin!\n\nThe national army officer scanned the dense crowds on both sides of the square and couldn't help but think: \"My batch Can the troops with advanced equipment defeat these shabby-looking troops of the Communist Party? \"\n\nAfter the ceremony, the officer wrote in a letter to his friend: \"The Communist Army is still very experienced.

However, due to the influence of various factors, the prices of bulk goods such as agricultural products, fuels, ore raw materials, and primary processed products are still rising slightly in the Japanese market. While this has increased the operating costs of Japanese companies and the living costs of Japanese people, it has also shaken people's economic confidence in Japan.

The supervisor did not insult him at all, but kowtowed as if he was pounding garlic.\n\n\"Well done, sir, sir, well done...I have been doing this for so many years...\"\n\nEveryone knows that being What does it mean to be thrown out in the factory? Wang Laogen was so frightened that he was about to cry. His wrinkled forehead almost had traces of blood on the ground, and he muttered fragmentary words of begging for mercy. What he got was not sympathy, but It was a polished leather shoe that kicked hard on the bridge of his nose. Severe pain was accompanied by warm blood. Wang Laogen was kicked to the ground again, and blood poured into him. His nostrils were filled with the smell of rust, and his eyes were only the red of blood.\n\n\"Stop fighting, don't fight...I'm going, I'm going, don't fight...\"\n\n He held himself in pain with his hands on the bridge of his nose when he was kicked, and moved his body back while whimpering. His ears were full of the Japanese's dirty words, and then there were blows on his ribs and abdomen. They kicked him violently like raindrops. Until he curled up and could no longer move, the Japanese supervisor left the half-dead Wang Laogen and returned to the factory with two indifferent and numb workers.\n\nWang Laogen was in the severe cold After lying there for a long time, he instinctively wanted to use his hands to support his body and stand up, but the empty sleeve on his right side made him fall to the ground again. And he squirmed his body and used his left elbow to support himself again. He stood up, holding on to his right hand that was clipped by the instrument, and with one trembling step, he disappeared into the long night of Manchuria.\n\nHe kept walking, kept walking, until he could no longer hold on, He fell on the street corner where garbage was piled up. The bone-chilling cold surrounded him, and his withered lips were stained with dark blood. He thought of his brother who resolutely went to fight against Japan. The contact between the brothers had long been severed. He knew that he had already died. He was about to die soon, and a few turbid tears dripped down his withered cheeks. He choked with sobs, wishing that he had not been so weak and followed his brother. It would be better to die on the battlefield than to die in this useless place. He curled up in a ball, sobbing and crying bitterly.\n\nThe sobs became smaller and smaller, until the last echoes disappeared, and the long night in Manchuria once again returned to a deathly state. silence."

 tnoub_chi.1150.d:0 "立法会的夜晚向来是大门锁死，任何人不得入内。但此时，长靴踏地的踢踏声回荡在立法会漆黑的长廊。靴子主人的步伐略显踌躇，有些犹豫。而当他推开走廊尽头一扇不起眼的木门后，昏黄的灯光自门内泄出，坐在门内等候来者许久的，正是广东国此刻最有权势的二人：盛田昭夫和李嘉诚。\n\n“宋先生。”盛田昭夫看着此刻正在关门的宋之光，起身以粤语问好道，“战事将近，此前我们已磋商数次。今夜叫您前来，也是为了给您一个答复。”尽管表现得冷静非凡，但盛田昭夫的心脏也跳的前所未有的快。他的手心此刻也已然汗湿，正装作不经意的搓揉自己的衣角。\n\n“当然，行政长官阁下。”宋之光理了理自己的衣领，“您的意愿便代表了广东国政府的意愿，我诚恳的想要知道您此刻的态度。”\n\n“嘉诚。”盛田昭夫仅是轻呼其挚友的名字，李嘉诚便点头，开口向宋之光问道：“在表达我们的意愿前，我们更想知道，中华民国对于我们提出的要求是何态度？”\n\n“我已经亲自请示了高总统。”宋之光故意停顿片刻，引出了面前二人对于他话的好奇，“对于二位的要求，无论是保持既有的《广东民生条例》及改革不得变动，还是李嘉诚先生特别强调的，赋予所有珠人中华民国国籍的要求，高总统表示全部同意。而战后，二位无论是加入我们新组建的政府，还是打算就此退休，我们都绝无有任何干涉。”\n\n听到这里，李嘉诚和盛田昭夫无不长呼出一口气。他们都知道，广东就是他们的一切，活在旭日的阴影之下，自己的改革随时都有可能被疯狂的日本宪兵，陆军或者满洲的境外势力付之一炬。想到这里，盛田昭夫挠了挠自己白发，沉思片刻之后，一字一顿的说道。\n\n“宋先生，请帮我致电高总统。在接下来的战事之中，广东国将作为抗击日本的一份子参战，而在战后，将不再作为独立国家，正式并入中华民国，成为中国的一份子。”\n\n在盛田昭夫说完之后，李嘉诚走上前，拍了拍宋之光的肩膀，低声在他的耳边说道：“为了广东和广东人民的未来，为了我们所有人的未来，我恳切的希望中华民国不要辜负所有人的期望。”\n\n听到这话，宋之光的脸上露出了难得的真切笑容。随后，便是郑重的承诺。"

 tnoub_chi.1151.d:0 "广东松下集团总部的高楼如一柱哨塔般伫立于广东繁华商业区的中心。几年前，宋之光曾经听闻松下正治父亲的办公室在大阪被称为“鹰巢”。而现在，当他从电梯里走出来的时候才意识到，松下正治的办公室和他父亲相比相比起恐怕是有过之而无不及。\n\n仅仅是站在这面环绕半屋的玻璃之后便能看到整个广东沉溺于霓灯溢彩的夜景，而松下正治本人此刻站在窗前，霓虹灯的闪耀模糊了他的脸庞，让宋之光都难以推断这位行政长官此刻在想什么。\n\n“宋领事。”松下在转身之前，以平淡却不容置疑的口吻说道，“我希望您这次同高总统会面之后，能给我带来满意的答复。”\n\n“当然。”宋之光走上前，从公文包里拿出一摞文件，摊在松下正治面前的桌子上，“高总统完全同意了您的要求，无论是在解放与松下集团展开亲密合作，还是对于您所做的商业改革保持最大的尊重，广东将会作为中国的经济开发区而独立存在……”\n\n宋之光的话没有继续往下说，因为他注意到松下此刻已经全身心的投入到对于文件的阅读中。出于外交上的礼貌，他选择保持沉默，房间里此刻只剩下木质时钟摆锤滴答晃动的轻微声响。直到一声纸张摊平桌面的轻响，松下的嘴角露出了克制的微笑，他缓缓起身，向宋之光伸出了手。\n\n“我很高兴民国政府能够同我们达成共识，宋领事，我同意这份协议。”\n\n“很高兴您愿意同意，这也就意味着，广东将会同民国在即将而来的战事中站在一边。”\n\n宋之光同松下握了握手，尽管如此，他仍然疑虑于松下的决心。这个本家在日本本岛的大亨真的会放弃他的家族，转而同中国合作吗？\n\n“行政长官阁下，这件合作的达成，对您而言意味着什么？”宋之光以精明的角度发问道，“您看起来如此轻松，这件事情对您而言同签一份商业合作一样简单吗？”\n\n听闻此言，松下仅仅是扯了扯嘴角，随后便转身看向了广东的万家灯火，“在十年前，我曾迫切的渴望本家的认可，那时候的我出台任何法案，都是为了达到更高的效益，为了能够满足本家的胃口。那时候我很担心自己能不配位，即便将石油危机引发的种种事宜都处理干净，我都寝食难安。直到，我想起我父亲和我说过的一句话。”\n\n他没有继续说下去，直到吊起宋之光的胃口，才一字一句道，“松下的未来在于创新。”\n\n“这一次的合作，便是我向我父亲交出的最后一份答卷。”他看向宋之光，喃喃说道，“在同民国的合作中，广东松下电器会超越一切的日本财阀。自然，也会超越本家。这便是松下集团超越了派系的企业精神，也是我贯彻至今的精神。”\n\n在宋之光最终离开之前，松下正治以一句话结束了这次的谈话。"

 tnoub_chi.4004.d:0 "Gāo Zōngwǔ once again sat opposite the Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan, but this time it was not the humble reporting work like before, nor the powerlessness during the Taipei Summit. Now they are truly, Absolute and true communication on an equal footing.\n\nHe tried his best to suppress the increasingly wild smile at the corner of his mouth. His close friend Táo Xīshèng didn't have to cover it up too much, and Táo Xīshèng usually greeted people with a smile. On the contrary, The faces of the Prime Minister and his subordinates across from him were not very good. They all had livid faces and suppressed the dissatisfaction and anger in their hearts.\n\nToday is the third agenda item of the summit, but there has already been a quarrel in the newspapers outside. From the China Daily to the Dong-A Ilbo to the Asahi Shimbun, every newspaper used front-page headlines in bold and bold to describe the situation of this summit, which was related to the survival of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The quarrels and conflicts between the two sides could not escape the camera. With the tacit approval of Gāo Zōngwǔ, more and more photos are being circulated through various media channels.\n\nThe intention expressed by Japan in the past two days has been very clear - Japan is the master of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is an iron law that cannot be violated. Any attempt to change the status quo of the distribution of forces in the Co-Prosperity Sphere will be crushed by the iron fist of the imperial army. Gāo Zōngwǔ also directly expressed his opinion-there is no need for the re-unification of Chinese, complete and complete Anyone can stop it. This is not a solicitation but a notice.\n\nUnder the illumination of countless flashlights, the two sides left the meeting. This will also be the last meeting between the leaders of both sides before the war is extinguished in the future. The Japanese Prime Minister and the others walked out. Heading directly to the airport to board the flight, countless newspaper headlines were filled with the smell of war smoke: "
