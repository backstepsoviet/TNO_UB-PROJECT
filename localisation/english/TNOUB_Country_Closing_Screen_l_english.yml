 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_CHI_GAW_Success: "The night after the victory, the old song \"Farewell\" was played on the radio on the desk of the office of the Presidential Palace. Listening to this farewell song, we seemed to see those who sacrificed their lives in pursuit of the independence of the country and the nation: from the Revolution of 1911 to the National People's Congress The Great Revolution, from the Anti-Japanese War to the humiliating defeat and then to the war that burned the fire of liberation across Greater East Asia. This is an elegy dedicated to them in the new world. The old world has been wiped out, but those heroes will not follow. They will be forgotten along with the torrent of history. On the contrary, their spirit will continue to inspire the creators of the new era to move forward."
